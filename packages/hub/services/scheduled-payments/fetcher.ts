  // This query fetches scheduled payments that are due to be executed now.
  // Will prioritize scheduled payments with no payment attempts.
  // After that scheduled payments with the earlier failed payment attempts.
  // Payment scheduler will periodically try to fetch these payments at regular intervals and execute them if they are due.
  // This query mostly relies on the payAt field, which is set to the time when the payment should be executed.
  // In case of one-time payments, payAt is set only initially, and then never changed.
  // In case of recurring payments, payAt will update on every successful payment (to 1 month in the future).
  // It is also important to note that validForDays tells us for how many days the payment is still valid to retry in
  // case it is failing for some reason.

  // In the case of scheduled payments that failed and need to be retried, the query will return only the scheduled payments
  // where enough time has passed since the last failed payment attempt. We allow maximum 8 failed attempts, and the time
  // between attempts is defined in the calculateRetryBackoffsInMinutes method.

  // validForDays could be different for each chainId, so we pass them as parameters (defined in scheduledPaymentConfig contract)

# Implementation notes for pgsearch refactor

3. Refactord cardstack_pristine, cardstack_references, etc, out of searchDoc.
5. verify cursor behavior in docsThatReference (either manually or write a test)
6. Improve DI system to remove hack where we do require.resolve during injections.
8. Switch filter default from non-exact to exact.
9. Drop implicit "any" array support inside operators like 'exact'
10. readOtherIndexers can become a full searcher, but that involves more sophisticated invalidation queries
uncachedRead should go away (this is easier to do if we replace readOtherIndexers with a full searcher)

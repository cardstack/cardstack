            As an Issuer, you assist customers in acquiring prepaid cards and reloading the balance when needed.
            Customers can then use their prepaid cards to purchase a variety of products &amp; services from
            participating merchants who accept Card Pay as a payment method.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>To fund a prepaid card, you need a balance of {{network-display-info "layer2" "daiToken"}} (Dai stablecoin) in your {{network-display-info "layer2" "fullName"}} wallet.</strong>
          </p>

              <strong>Fees:</strong> Issuers may charge an issuance fee for each prepaid card they issue to a
              customer. This could be a flat fee or a percentage of the face value. In addition, issuers may
              charge a processing fee for issuing prepaid cards that are purchased via credit card payment.

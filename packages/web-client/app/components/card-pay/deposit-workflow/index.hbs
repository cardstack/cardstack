          As a Supplier, you deposit funds from your Ethereum mainnet wallet into the
          CARD Protocol's reserve pool and receive the corresponding amount of CPXD
          tokens in your xDai chain wallet.
        </p>
        <p>
          We currently support two types of asset you can deposit into the reserve pool:
          <ul>
            <li>Dai stablecoins (DAI)</li>
            <li>Cardstack ERC-20 tokens (CARD)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The CARD Protocol's reserve pool facilitates payments between customers
          and merchants on the Cardstack network.

            <strong>Fees:</strong> Suppliers earn transaction fees of 0.5% for all transactions across
            the CARD Protocol. Those fees will be distributed to Suppliers based on
            their proportional share of supplied tokens in the reserve pool, averaged
            over the 30-day period in which the transactions occurred. <a href="#">More details here.</a>

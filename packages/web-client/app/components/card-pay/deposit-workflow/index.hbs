            As a Supplier, you deposit funds from your {{network-display-info "layer1" "fullName"}} wallet into the
            CARD Protocol’s reserve pool and receive the corresponding amount of CPXD
            tokens in your {{network-display-info "layer2" "fullName"}} wallet.
          </p>
          <p>
            We currently support two types of asset you can deposit into the reserve pool:
            <ul>
              <li>Dai stablecoins (DAI)</li>
              <li>Cardstack ERC-20 tokens (CARD)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            The CARD Protocol’s reserve pool facilitates payments between customers
            and businesses on the Cardstack network.
          </p>

              <strong>Fees:</strong> Suppliers earn transaction fees of 0.5% for all transactions across
              the CARD Protocol. Those fees will be distributed to Suppliers based on
              their proportional share of supplied tokens in the reserve pool, averaged
              over the 30-day period in which the transactions occurred. <a href="#">More details here.</a>

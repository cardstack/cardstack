            As a Supplier, you deposit funds from your Ethereum Mainnet wallet into the CARD Protocol’s Reserve Pool and receive the corresponding amount of CPXD tokens in your xDai Chain wallet.
          </p>
          <p class="expandable-banner-usage-paragraph">
            We currently support two types of asset you can deposit into the Reserve Pool:
            <ul class="expandable-banner-usage-list">
              <li>Dai stablecoins (DAI)</li>
              <li>Cardstack ERC-20 tokens (CARD)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p class="expandable-banner-usage-paragraph">
            The CARD Protocol’s Reserve Pool facilitates payments between customers and merchants on the Cardstack Network.
          </p>
          <p class="expandable-banner-usage-paragraph expandable-banner-usage-fine-print">
            Fees: Suppliers earn transaction fees of 0.5% for all transactions across the CARD Protocol. Those fees will be distributed to Suppliers based on their proportional share of supplied tokens in the Reserve Pool, averaged over the 30-day period in which the transactions occurred. <a class="expandable-banner-usage-link" href="#">More details here.</a>

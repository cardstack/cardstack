# cardpay-cli <!-- omit in toc -->
=============

CLI tool for basic actions in Cardpay

# Install
To install the Cardpay CLI run the following command:

```sh
curl -o- -L https://install.cardstack.com/install-cardpay.sh | bash
```
This will install the Cardpay CLI to your ~/.cardpay folder, as well as add the `cardpay` bin to your $PATH env var. Note that node ver 14+ is required to be installed on your system in order for the Cardpay CLI to run.

# Running
To run the Cardpay CLI type:
```sh
cardpay <command> <arguments> [options]
```

The commands are listed below (which you can view using --help option). Each command has arguments specific to it. The options indicate how you wish to connect to your wallet. You can either provide your mnemonic seed (as either an environment variable `MNEMONIC_PHRASE` or using the `--mnemonic` param. Or you can specify `--walletConnect` to use the cardpay wallet app. A QR code will be displayed that you can scan in your cardwallet app, which will connect the CLI to your cardwallet.

## Running within the development environment
If you wish to run the CLI within the development environment, then you can use the `yarn cardpay` yarn script.

First, ensure that the monorepo and cardpay-sdk package are setup correctly:
```sh
cd cardstack
yarn
cd packages/cardpay-sdk
yarn prepack
cd ../cardpay-cli
```

Then, simply run the command in the `packages/cardpay-cli` workspace and prefix the command with `yarn`. e.g.

```sh
yarn cardpay safe list --walletConnect
```

Cardstack Application Framework
===============================

This is the main repo for [Cardstack](https://www.cardstack.com/), an open source application architecture for building cohesive experiences on open, decentralized infrastructure.

## Orientation 

This is a monorepo. Each directory under `packages` is distributed as a standalone NPM package under the `@cardstack` NPM namespace. Each package is a Cardstack plugin. A family of Cardstack plugins comes together to provide both browser-side and server-side functionality of a Cardstack application.

Many Cardstack plugins are also [Ember addons](https://ember-cli.com/extending/#developing-addons-and-blueprints), which is the standard way for a Cardstack plugin to provide client-side functionality.

### Cardstack Plugin Features

A Cardstack Plugin is any npm package with "cardstack-plugin" in its `package.json`'s `keywords` list. It may export any number of *features*. Each feature falls into one of the following feature types.

| Feature Type              | Description              |
| --------------------------|--------------------------|
| authenticator             | Server-side functions and client-side components for authenticating users against some authentication sources. Examples: @cardstack/github-auth, @cardstack/drupal-auth, @cardstack/email-auth                  |
| code-generator            | Allows a cardstack plugin to emit dynamically changing Javascript that can be both precompiled into an app and dynamically reloaded on demand. Examples: @cardstack/models, @cardstack/hub::environment        |
| constraint-type           | A logical constraint that users may configure and apply to their data models. Examples: @cardstack/core-types::max-length |
| field-type                | Validation, formatting, and editor components for a scalar data type. Examples: @cardstack/core-types::string, @cardstack/mobiledoc       |
| indexer                   | Indexes content from some arbitrary external data source into Cardstack Hub's fast cache. Examples: @cardstack/git, @cardstack/postgresql, @cardstack/drupal |
| messenger                 | Implements a way to send messages out to some arbitrary data sink. Example: @cardstack/email |
| middleware                | Allows a plugin to install arbitrary server-side middleware. This is a fairly low-level feature -- often you can implement more specific feature types instead, relying on standard middleware like @cardstack/jsonapi. Examples: @cardstack/jsonapi, @cardstack/authentication |
| searcher                  | Provides deep searches in some data source (as opposed to an indexer, which pre-indexes external data sources for fast local searches). An example is the @cardstack/elasticsearch searcher, which is the default searcher used internally by Cardstack Hub.
| writers                   | Writes content back out to some arbitrary external data source. Works in tandem with an indexer or searcher to provide full round-trip integration. Examples: @cardstack/git, @cardstack/postgresql. |


### Cardstack Plugins in this Repo

While third-party Cardstack plugins are heartily encouraged, the plugins in this repo (and distributed under the `@cardstack/` NPM namespace) comprise the core Cardstack framework and are therefore subject to Cardstack's community governance and stability policies.

## Developing and Testing within this Repo

In development, we use `lerna` to manage the inter-dependencies of all the packages. To get started:

 1. Install node >= 8.
 2. Install yarn >= 0.28 (earlier versions work but will not benefit from [Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/).
 3. `yarn global add lerna` (use >= 2.0.0 for yarn workspaces integration)
 4. `lerna bootstrap` 


### Test Suite Dependencies

There is work-in-progress to make Cardstack Hub automatically manage docker-based microservices, but for the present you need to start these things up manually to run the full test suite:

    docker run -d -p 9200:9200 --rm cardstack/elasticsearch:dev
    docker run -d -p 5444:5432 --rm cardstack/pg-test

Additionally, for the Ethereum tests, you'll need to start a private blockchain. We use [truffle](http://truffleframework.com/docs/) to orchestrate our private blockchain and clear on-chain state
in between the tests. You can start a private blockchain by executing:
```
yarn run blockchain &
```


## Project-wide Policy and Community Governance

Cardstack follows semantic versioning. As a young, pre-1.0 project, this means you can continue to expect breaking changes in minor releases. Each package should endeavor to include a CHANGELOG.md once it begins to have a non-trivial number of external users.

We intend to adopt a community RFC governance process for public API changes, based on the Rust and Ember projects. At this pre-1.0 stage, RFCs are optional and changes may still be fast and furious.

Cardstack follows the [Ember Community Guidelines](https://emberjs.com/guidelines/), both because we are a proper subset of the existing Ember community and because we wholeheartedly endorse the same values.
